# Generative-Learning-With-Discrete-and-Continuous-VAE
Using VAE based netural network in order to learn the disiturbtion space which the photos are getting sampled and generate new photos.

## General
The goal is to bulid deep learning based generative model. In order to that the network learn the disiturbtion space of the photos and sample from it.

### Background
VAE is an autoencoder whose encodings distribution is regularised during the training in order to ensure that its latent space has good properties allowing us to generate some new data. Moreover, the term “variational” comes from the close relation there is between the regularisation and the variational inference method in statistics.
